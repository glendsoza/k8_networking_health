# K8 Networking Health

KNH is a tool to check the networking health of your kubernetes cluster.

## Overview
KNH is a kubernetes networking healt checker based on the bully alogrithm. It is meant to be deployed as a kubernetes daemonset or a deployment. 
Once deployed through a leader election mechanism a coordinator is elected and the coordinator is responsible for communicating with other KNH pods in the cluster. In case coordinator fails to communicate with the pod a webhook is triggered to indicate the failure of the peer. In case of failure of coordinator through election mechanism a new coordinator is elected and the process will continue.

Status of all the nodes on which KNH pods are spawned will also be posted to a webhook

## How it works ?
KNH is based on the modified version of bully algorithm implimentation found here [TimTosi/bully-algorithm](https://github.com/TimTosi/bully-algorithm)

Each KNH pods hosts a bully which exposes two http endpoint `/ping` to respond to health check and `/coordinator` to set coordinator 
 
Using the [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) package information about the IP's of other KNH pods are obtained and added as peers. IP's are updated after each end point refresh which may occur due to re-deployment or KNH pods being scaled up or down

In case coordinator fails to communicate with the pod a post request will me made to configured endpoint with the following payload
```
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "peer": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "address": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "alive": {
          "type": "boolean"
        },
        "node_name": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "id",
        "address",
        "alive",
        "node_name"
      ]
    },
    "coordinator": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "coordinator_address": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "peer",
    "coordinator",
    "coordinator_address"
  ]
}
```
```
{"peer":{"id":"my-node1@103205","address":"10.32.0.5:8080","alive":false,"node_name":"my-node1"},"coordinator":"my-node@103209","coordinator_address":"10.32.0.9:8080"}
```
This webhook will be triggered once when the pod which was responding becuase unresponsive, if the pod becomes responsive again it will be added back to list of peers with `alive` as true but no webhooks will be triggered

Satus of all the peers will also be posted after each leader election to configured endpoints with the following payload 
```
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "peer_map": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": [
        {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "id": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "address": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "alive": {
              "type": "boolean"
            },
            "node_name": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "required": [
            "id",
            "address",
            "alive",
            "node_name"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    "coordinator": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "coordinator_address": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "peer_map",
    "coordinator",
    "coordinator_address"
  ]
}
```
```
{"peer_map":[{"id":"my-node1@103205","address":"10.32.0.5:8080","alive":true,"node_name":"my-node1"}],"coordinator":"my-node0@103209","coordinator_address":"10.32.0.9:8080"}
```

## Installation and using it in the K8 Cluster

- Clone the repo 
- Stat to the project root and build the docker image by running
- Create a sample deamonset as follows 
- Run kubectl apply -f 
- Verify all the pods are up and running
